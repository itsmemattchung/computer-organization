I added this file because I'm trying to troubleshoot an issue with sharelatex.com. From their page, I am attempting to import this repository—after upgrading to their paid version—but I keep getting hit with the following error: "Sorry, there was an error talking to our GitHub service. Please try again in a few moments."

I'm wondering if their service fails to retrieve contents from Github because this repository, as well as the other (discrete-mathematics) is empty. Completely blank.

So, after committing this file, I'll return to sharelatex.com, attempting to initiate another sync.
